  caveats <<~EOS
    The bundle is not notarised. On first launch, Gatekeeper will block
    it: right-click deskHPSDR.app in Finder and choose "Open", then
    confirm in the dialog. Alternatively, run:

      xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/deskHPSDR.app

    Upstream provides Apple Silicon builds only; there is no Intel build.
