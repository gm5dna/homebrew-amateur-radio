  caveats <<~EOS
    The macOS build is ad-hoc signed and not notarised, so Gatekeeper will
    block it on first launch: open the app, dismiss the warning, then
    choose "Open Anyway" in System Settings → Privacy & Security.
    Alternatively, run:

      xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OnAir.app
